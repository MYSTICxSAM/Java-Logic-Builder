# Java-Logic-Builder

Welcome to the Java Logic Builder repository! This project is dedicated to helping individuals strengthen their Java programming skills, starting from the basics and progressing towards more complex data structures and algorithms (DSA). Whether you're a beginner looking to learn Java or someone aiming to enhance your problem-solving skills on platforms like LeetCode, this repository has something for you.

## Project Structure

Basic Java Questions: We begin with fundamental Java problems to build a strong foundation in logic and programming concepts. This section is perfect for those new to Java or looking to refresh their basics.

Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA): After mastering the basics, we dive into essential DSA topics such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, and more. Each section will include problems that help solidify your understanding and prepare you for coding challenges.

## Goals

Build a solid foundation in Java programming.
Develop problem-solving skills for coding interviews and competitive programming.
Provide clear explanations and structured learning paths for each topic.
Let's code, learn, and grow together!
