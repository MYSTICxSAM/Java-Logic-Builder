# Sorting Algorithms
This folder contains a collection of sorting algorithms implemented in Java. Sorting is a fundamental concept in computer science, and understanding various sorting techniques is crucial for solving a wide range of problems efficiently.

## Overview
Sorting algorithms are used to arrange elements in a specific order (ascending or descending). This folder covers both basic and advanced sorting algorithms, providing insights into their working mechanisms, time complexities, and use cases.

## Algorithms Covered
Bubble Sort: A simple comparison-based algorithm where each pair of adjacent elements is compared and swapped if they are in the wrong order.

- Selection Sort: This algorithm divides the array into a sorted and an unsorted region, repeatedly selecting the smallest element from the unsorted region and moving it to the sorted region.

- Insertion Sort: Builds the sorted array one item at a time by repeatedly picking the next element and inserting it into its correct position.

- Merge Sort: A divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the array into halves, sorts each half, and then merges the sorted halves.

- Quick Sort: Another divide-and-conquer algorithm that picks a 'pivot' element, partitions the array into elements less than and greater than the pivot, and recursively sorts the partitions.

- Heap Sort: A comparison-based algorithm that builds a heap from the array, repeatedly extracts the maximum element, and rebuilds the heap.

- Radix Sort: A non-comparative sorting algorithm that sorts numbers by processing individual digits.
